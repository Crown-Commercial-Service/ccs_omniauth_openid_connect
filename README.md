# OmniAuth::OpenIDConnect

Originally was [omniauth-openid-connect](https://github.com/m0n9oose/omniauth_openid_connect)

As support for the previous gem was dropped, this meant that it was not compatible with `omniauth v2` which had some significant updates. Therefore, the repository was forked and the changes were made so that the gem is compatible with `omniauth >= v2`.

For full instructions on how to use the gem, please view the [documentation for omniauth-openid-connect](https://github.com/m0n9oose/omniauth_openid_connect#readme)
